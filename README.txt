This is a Rust library to help generate prime numbers.

It came about because I'm trying to learn Rust by going through the Project
Euler (http://projecteuler.net) problems. The algorithm for determining whether
a number is prime is based off the Python implementation of the Wikipedia page
"Primality test" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test), and then
performance was improved by requiring a list of previously generated primes to
be provided.
